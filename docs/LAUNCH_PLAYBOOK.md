# ARGUS-AI Launch Playbook

## Phase 1: Repository Setup (Day 0)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd argus-ai
git init
git add .
git commit -m "v0.1.0: G-ARVIS scoring engine, agentic metrics, threshold monitoring

- G-ARVIS composite scorer (6 dimensions: G/A/R/V/I/S)
- Agentic evaluation metrics: ASF, ERR, CPCS
- 3-line SDK: init/evaluate/score
- Threshold monitoring with sliding window breach detection
- Prometheus and OpenTelemetry exporters
- Drop-in Anthropic and OpenAI provider wrappers
- 84 unit tests, 93%+ core coverage
- Apache 2.0 license"

git remote add origin git@github.com:anilatambharii/argus-ai.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Settings

1. Add description: "Production-grade LLM observability in 3 lines. G-ARVIS scoring for Groundedness, Accuracy, Reliability, Variance, Inference Cost, and Safety."
2. Add topics: `llm`, `observability`, `ai-safety`, `mlops`, `monitoring`, `evaluation`, `production-ai`, `garvis`, `agentic-ai`, `python`
3. Set homepage URL: `https://argus-ai.ambharii.com`
4. Enable Discussions
5. Enable Sponsors (link to ambharii.com)

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0: Initial open-source release"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Create release on GitHub with CHANGELOG.md content as release notes.

### Step 4: Publish to PyPI

```bash
pip install twine build
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

Verify: `pip install argus-ai && python -c "import argus_ai; print(argus_ai.__version__)"`

## Phase 2: Content Launch (Days 0-3)

### Day 0: LinkedIn Newsletter

Publish Edition 4 of "Field Notes: Production AI" (see docs/linkedin-launch-edition4.md).

Pin the post. Reply to every comment within 2 hours for the first 48 hours.

### Day 0: X/Twitter Thread

Post 1:
"I just open-sourced the G-ARVIS scoring engine.

pip install argus-ai

3 lines of code. Every LLM call now has a quality score across 6 dimensions.

Your LLM app is degrading right now. You just cannot see it. Thread below."

Post 2:
"G-ARVIS evaluates every LLM response across:
G - Groundedness (hallucination detection)
A - Accuracy (factual correctness)
R - Reliability (format consistency)
V - Variance (output stability)
I - Inference Cost (token efficiency)
S - Safety (PII, toxicity, injection)

One composite score. Sub-5ms."

Post 3:
"New in v0.1.0: Agentic evaluation metrics.

ASF (Agent Stability Factor)
ERR (Error Recovery Rate)
CPCS (Cost Per Completed Step)

Traditional metrics like BLEU/ROUGE were not designed for 10-step autonomous workflows. These were."

Post 4:
"Open core strategy:

Open source: G-ARVIS scorer, SDK, monitoring, exporters
Proprietary: Autonomous correction loop, self-healing pipeline

Detection is free. The fix is what you pay for.

github.com/anilatambharii/argus-ai"

### Day 1: Hacker News

Title: "Show HN: argus-ai – G-ARVIS scoring engine for LLM observability (3 lines of code)"

Comment:
"Author here. I have been running LLMs in production across Fortune 100s (Duke Energy, UnitedHealth, R1 RCM) for years. The consistent pattern: apps work great at launch, then silently degrade while traditional metrics show green.

G-ARVIS scores six dimensions (Groundedness, Accuracy, Reliability, Variance, Inference Cost, Safety) in sub-5ms with zero external dependencies. Threshold monitoring with sliding window breach detection tells you when quality is trending down before it becomes an incident.

New in this release: three agentic evaluation metrics (ASF, ERR, CPCS) for autonomous workflow monitoring. Traditional metrics like BLEU/ROUGE were not built for 10-step tool-using agents.

Apache 2.0. Open core model: scoring and monitoring are free. The autonomous correction loop stays proprietary.

Happy to answer questions about the framework, production LLM observability, or the open-core strategy."

### Day 2: Reddit

Post to r/MachineLearning (D), r/LangChain, r/LocalLLaMA.

Title: "[P] argus-ai: G-ARVIS scoring engine for production LLM observability"

### Day 3: Medium Cross-Post

Adapt the LinkedIn newsletter into a Medium article on @anilAmbharii. Add code examples and architecture diagrams.

## Phase 3: Community Growth (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: First Contributors

1. Create "good first issue" labels on 3-5 issues:
   - "Add LiteLLM integration"
   - "Add LangChain callback handler"
   - "Add Datadog exporter"
   - "Add CLI tool for batch scoring"
   - "Improve groundedness scorer with sentence embeddings"

2. Respond to every issue and PR within 24 hours.

### Week 2: Ecosystem Integration

1. Submit PR to awesome-llm-apps lists
2. Submit PR to awesome-mlops lists
3. Contact LiteLLM maintainers about native integration
4. Contact LangChain about callback handler inclusion

### Week 3: Benchmarks and Content

1. Publish benchmark comparing argus-ai scoring speed vs alternatives
2. Write "How We Monitor 50M LLM Calls with G-ARVIS" case study
3. Create Grafana dashboard screenshot gallery (use docs/grafana-dashboard.json)

### Week 4: CAIO Circle Presentation

Present argus-ai at CAIO Circle Tri-State Chapter meeting. Collect feedback from peer CDOs/CTOs. Use as validation signal for LinkedIn content.

---

## Phase 4: Platform Tease (Month 2)

### Actions

1. Add "ARGUS Platform" section to README with waitlist link
2. Publish Edition 5: "Why Detection Without Correction Is Just a Dashboard"
3. Demo the autonomous correction loop (video, not code) on LinkedIn
4. Open GitHub Discussion: "What would you want from autonomous LLM correction?"

### Goal

Convert argus-ai users into ARGUS Platform waitlist sign-ups. The hook is working when developers say "I can see the degradation but I cannot fix it automatically."
