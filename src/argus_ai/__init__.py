ARGUS-AI: Production-Grade LLM Observability

The G-ARVIS scoring engine for Groundedness, Accuracy, Reliability,
Variance, Inference Cost, and Safety monitoring of LLM applications.

Quick Start (3 lines):

    import argus_ai
    argus = argus_ai.init()
    score = argus.evaluate(prompt=prompt, response=response, context=context)
